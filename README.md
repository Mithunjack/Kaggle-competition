# Kaggle Competitions Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Kaggle Competitions Repository! As a recent Master's degree graduate, I've embarked on a journey through the world of data science by participating in Kaggle competitions. This repository is a record of my endeavors, aiming to participate in at least one competition each month. It serves as a personal progress tracker and a resource for others interested in data science and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository is named after the Kaggle competition I've participated in. Inside each, you'll find various versions of my submissions, including data explorations, models, visualizations, and the final submission. 
The structure is as follows:

```
Kaggle-Competition/
│
├── Competition-Name-1/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── v2_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
├── Competition-Name-2/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
└── ...

```



## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore Competitions**: Browse through the competition folders to see my journey in each.
2. **View Submissions**: Inside each folder, multiple submission versions highlight the progression of my solutions.
3. **Final Submissions**: The `final_submission.ipynb` file in each folder represents my final approach for the competition.
4. **Feedback and Collaboration**: Feel free to provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest collaborations. Open an issue or submit a pull request!

## Learning and Sharing

I'm committed to learning and sharing knowledge throughout this journey. Each submission in this repository is an opportunity to explore different techniques and methodologies in data science and machine learning.

- **Learning**: Gain insights into various data science problems and solutions.
- **Sharing**: Join me in discussing and improving upon these solutions.
